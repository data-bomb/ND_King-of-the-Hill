# [ND] King of the Hill

A SourceMod gamemode plugin for Nuclear Dawn.

## Description:
Teams fight over control of the Primary Resource Point in timed round matches.
The team who controls Prime for the longest amount of time will win the round.



## Additional Features:
- turned off all tertiary and secondary resource resource points
- no building within x distance of primary resource point
- no commander abilities within x distance of primary resource point
- no building too close to enemy bunker - action is in the middle
- make starting map structures invulnerable to sieging
- make new structures harder to destroy
- force bots to capture/defend main point only
- limit nades for team defending prime

## Future Considerations:
- Add translations support
- Improve balance
